 * The interface defines the core image manipulation

 * for the classes that implement it to interact with the graphical user
 * interface (GUI), handling image operations such as loading, saving,
 * applying effects (sepia, blur, sharpen, etc.), and adjusting various
 * image properties (e.g., brightness, compression, downscaling).
 * Implementing classes should provide the actual logic for each operation,
 * which is then invoked by the GUI based on user interactions.
 * Implementing this interface allows a clear, consistent way to handle
